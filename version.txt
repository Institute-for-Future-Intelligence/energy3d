Version 0.1
- draw walls
- draw edit points
- edit base points of a wall by dragging its edit points
- edit height of a wall by dragging its upper edit points.
	- this was done using "closest points" algorithm of two lines in 3D to computer closest point to mouse cursor that resides on the vertical line based at current edit point.
- snap walls to eachother
	- query a list of all drawn walls and find closest snap point within 0.5 radius (to be customized).
	- for base of wall, snapped point will be used as new coordinates.
	- for height of wall, snapped point will be used as closest coordinate and before computing wall heigh
- allow snap for when creating walls as well as when editing walls
- draw doors
	- based points can only be at bottom of target wall
	- height of door adjusts equaly at both ends
	- rotate/translate door points everytime the target wall is edited
