Version 0.1 (Released March 18, 2010)

- draw walls
- draw edit points
- edit base points of a wall by dragging its edit points
- edit height of a wall by dragging its upper edit points.
	- this was done using "closest points" algorithm of two lines in 3D to computer closest point to mouse cursor that resides on the vertical line based at current edit point.
- snap walls to each other
	- query a list of all drawn walls and find closest snap point within 0.5 radius (to be customized).
	- for base of wall, snapped point will be used as new coordinates.
	- for height of wall, snapped point will be used as closest coordinate and before computing wall heigh
- allow snap for when creating walls as well as when editing walls
- draw Doors
	- based points can only be at bottom of target wall
	- height of door adjusts equally at both ends
	- rotate/translate door points every time the target wall is edited
- User can now drag mouse to draw walls and door.
	- easier than multiple clicks
	- viewpoint changes as mouse dragged
- draw Roof
	- select a wall, automatically detect all connected walls, extract upper point of connected walls, finally generate polygon of wall
	- when snapping walls, record and store the neighboring walls. 
	- Refer to neighboring data when making roof to properly generate polygons.	  
	- Can now draw roof of non-convex houses.
- draw Window
	- can be added anywhere on wall
	- *TODO: do not allow window height to exceed height of wall
- draw both doors and windows with an offset so that they are always rendered in front of wall
- cut holes inside wall when drawing window
- draw wall thickness
	- draw back face polygon
	- draw surrounding thickness
	- automatically draw back face of wall behind the front page based on camera view point

	- automatically update container/children upon pick/insert even for those objects that don't need to know their container or children
- move addPoint(..) and allocateNewPoint(..) to superclass in order to automate it
- prevent camera view direction from moving when editing/dragging object points
- cleaned the code
- remember previous wall height and use it as default height of next wall
- snap when changing wall height
- BUG: mouse would select edit point of first added object regardless of visibility (ie. editing at point of intersection of two walls)
	- select the behind object if already selected and if the pick distance is not too much from the front object (0.1)
	- now it will select if hovering mouse near edit point, even if does not touch the object :)
- BUG: mouse would select the mesh itself instead of edit points due to mesh being closer to center of edit points
	- fixed by giving priority to edit points when comparing
- draw roof with an offset with respect to walls to make it look more realistic
- allow putting walls (or any other object) on a list of possible containers, i.e. on Foundation or directly on floor
- add option to switch the view of the scene to Top View in Parallel perspective and allow inserting walls to draw house plan
- make HousePart object serializable and initialize them in init() method

- using FirstPersonControl for better navigation
- using Q and Z for up and down navigation
